# IPL_Teams_Consecutive_Win_Or_Lose_Status

All the data is taken from the data provided
I have used Java Programming in making this project.
I have used oops concept in making classes and objects
2 ArrayList are used one for storing the data of all the teams , i.e their names , their total point , their last five match results and second one storee the Filtered teams names 
Two different functions have been used one for calculating and seperating the filtered teams according to the user and other function for printing the list of Filtered teams
I have named all the variables and methods in such a way to understand the code easily.
The output of the code will give you the name of the teams with consecutive win or lose according to the user for the number of times the user want.
